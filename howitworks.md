# How it works

## Arteries  
Arteries: blood delivery to tissues and organs<br />
Veins: blood return to the heart<br />

## Hemoglobin  
The hemoglobin without oxygen we will call de oxygenated hemoglobin (deoxy Hb).  
The hemoglobin with oxygen, we will call oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy Hb).

## Beer's Law (aka, Beer-Lambert Law)
Beer's Law states that the concentration of a chemical solution is directly proportional to its absorption of light.

### Light Absorption in Finger
The light emitted from the source has to travel through the artery. The light travels in a shorter path in the narrow artery and travels through a longer path in the wider artery ( paths are shown as green lines below). Though the concentration of Hb is the same in both arteries, the light meets more Hb in the wider artery, since it travels in a longer path. Therefore, longer the path the light has to travel, more is the light absorbed.

The distance between the “tips” of the waves is equal to the wavelength.
